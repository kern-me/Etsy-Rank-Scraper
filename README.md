"Eranker" is designed to automate the collection of Etsy keyword data from the keyword research platform "Erank". It does all the manual work of copying and pasting keyword data.

# Version #
* Eranker
* 2.1.0

# Why Tho? #
Gathering keyword data is one of the most important parts of Etsy SEO. The process of gathering the data is monotonous and time-consuming. I wrote this script so that I could gather data about keywords while I was away from my computer automatically!

Having all the metrics allows you to make decisions on what keywords are the best for your products.
